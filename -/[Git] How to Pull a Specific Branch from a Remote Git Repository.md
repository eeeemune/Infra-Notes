# ðŸ’š How to Pull a Specific Branch from a Remote Git Repository

## ðŸ’› 1. Check Remote Branches

First, list all branches available on the remote:

```bash
git fetch
git branch -r
```

Youâ€™ll see something like:

```
origin/main
origin/feature/login
origin/dev
```

## ðŸ’› 2. Pull a Specific Branch (first time)

If the branch doesnâ€™t exist locally yet:

```bash
git checkout -b my-branch origin/my-branch
```

This:

- Creates a new local branch called `my-branch`
- Tracks the remote branch `origin/my-branch`

## ðŸ’› 3. Pull Updates (branch already exists locally)

If youâ€™ve already checked it out:

```bash
git checkout my-branch
git pull origin my-branch
```

## ðŸ’› Bonus: Just Download Without Switching

To fetch but **not switch** to that branch:

```bash
git fetch origin my-branch
```

The branch data will be downloaded and available as `origin/my-branch`.
