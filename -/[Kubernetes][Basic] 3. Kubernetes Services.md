`Pod`s in Kubernetes are **temporary** ‚Äî they can be created and destroyed at any time. For example:
- If a Node crashes, the Pods on it disappear.

- The cluster might create **new Pods** elsewhere to keep things running.

But here‚Äôs the problem:
üëâ Every Pod has a **different IP address**, so how can other apps or users keep track?
üí° **That‚Äôs why we need a Service!**
A **`Service`** is like a **stable doorway** to a group of Pods.
Even if the Pods come and go, the Service stays the same.
## üíõ Why Use a Service?
**A Service is how people or apps find and talk to your app ‚Äî even if it moves around!**

1.  Service **routes traffic** to the right Pods

    - even if they restart or move
    
1. It **discovers** and tracks healthy Pods

1. It **exposes** your app to the world!

## üíõ Types of Services
You can **expose your app in different ways** using the `type` field in the Service definition:
### ü§ç ClusterIP
- **Default**

- Only reachable **inside the cluster**

- Great for internal services (e.g. backend)

### ü§ç NodePort
- Exposes your app to the **outside world** using `NodeIP:NodePort`

- Adds a public port to each Node

### ü§ç LoadBalancer
- Works in cloud environments (like GCP, AWS)

- **Creates an external load balancer** with a real public IP

### ü§ç ExternalName
- Doesn‚Äôt route traffic ‚Äî instead, maps the Service to a DNS name (like `my-db.company.com`)

- Useful for connecting to things **outside** the cluster

## üíõ How Do Services Know Where to Send Traffic?
They use **`Labels`**! üè∑Ô∏è
- Each Pod has labels like `app: my-app`, `tier: backend`

- The Service has a **selector** that says:
‚ÄúSend traffic to Pods with label `app: my-app`‚Äù

### ü§ç Example: Service with Selector
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080

```
This sends traffic from `my-service:80` to all Pods labeled `app: my-app` on port `8080`.
## üíõ What if There's No Selector?
If you don‚Äôt include a selector, you can:
- Manually define endpoints (for advanced setups)

- Or use `type: ExternalName` to connect to something outside the cluster

## ü§ç Summary
‚úÖ Services give your app a **stable connection point**
‚úÖ They **balance traffic** between Pods
‚úÖ They **keep things running** even when Pods change

Kubernetes¬†[[Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/)¬†are mortal. Pods have a¬†[[lifecycle](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/). **When a worker node dies, the Pods running on the Node are also lost.** A¬†[[Replicaset](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/)¬†might then dynamically drive the cluster back to the desired state via the creation of new Pods to keep your application running. As another example, consider an image-processing backend **with 3 replicas**. Those replicas are exchangeable; the front-end system should not care about backend replicas or even if a Pod is lost and recreated. That said, **each Pod in a Kubernetes cluster has a unique IP address**, even Pods on the same Node, so there needs to be a way of automatically reconciling changes among Pods so that your applications continue to function.

***A*** `Kubernetes Service` ***is an abstraction layer which defines a logical set of Pods and enables external traffic exposure, load balancing and service discovery for those Pods.***

A¬†[`[Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)¬†in Kubernetes is an abstraction which defines a **logical set of Pods and a policy** by which to access them. Services enable a loose coupling between dependent Pods. **A Service is defined using YAML or JSON**, like all Kubernetes object manifests. The set of Pods targeted by a Service is **usually determined by a¬†*label selector***¬†(see below for why you might want a Service without including a¬†`selector`¬†in the spec).

Although each Pod has a unique IP address, those **IPs are not exposed outside the cluster without a Service**. **Services allow your applications to receive traffic**. **Services can be exposed in different ways** by specifying a¬†`type`¬†in the¬†`spec`¬†of the Service:

- `*ClusterIP*`¬†(default) - Exposes the Service on an internal IP in the cluster. This type makes the Service **only reachable from within the cluster**.
- `*NodePort*`¬†- Exposes the Service on the same port of each selected Node in the cluster using NAT. Makes a Service accessible from outside the cluster using¬†`NodeIP:NodePort`. Superset of ClusterIP.
- `*LoadBalancer*`¬†- Creates an **external load balancer** in the current cloud (if supported) and assigns a fixed, external IP to the Service. Superset of NodePort.
- `*ExternalName*`¬†- Maps the Service to the contents of the¬†`externalName`¬†field (e.g.¬†`foo.bar.example.com`), by returning a¬†`CNAME`¬†record with its value. No proxying of any kind is set up. This type requires v1.7 or higher of¬†`kube-dns`, or CoreDNS version 0.0.8 or higher.

More information about the different types of Services can be found in the¬†[[Using Source IP](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/source-ip/)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/source-ip/)¬†tutorial. Also see¬†[[Connecting Applications with Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/connect-applications-service/)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/connect-applications-service/).

Additionally, note that there are some use cases with Services that involve not defining a¬†`selector`¬†in the spec. A Service created without¬†`selector`¬†will also not create the corresponding Endpoints object. This allows users to manually map a Service to specific endpoints. Another possibility why there may be no selector is you are strictly using¬†`type: ExternalName`.

A **Service routes traffic across a set of Pods**. Services are the abstraction that allows pods to die and replicate in Kubernetes without impacting your application. Discovery and **routing among dependent Pods** (such as the frontend and backend components in an application) are handled by Kubernetes Services.

`Services` **match a set of Pods using¬†[[labels and selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/)**, a grouping primitive that allows logical operation on objects in Kubernetes. Labels are key/value pairs attached to objects and can be used in any number of ways:

- **Designate objects** for development, test, and production
- Embed **version tags**
- **Classify an object** using tags
