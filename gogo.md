# 💚 Background

## 💛 Monoliths

<aside>

**Monoliths**

A **monolith** is a large single block of stone. In software architecture, it refers to a **large, single-tiered application** where all components are tightly coupled and interdependent.

</aside>

### 🤍 Disadvantages of Monoliths

- **Tight Coupling**
    - **Too many interdependent** parts make the system fragile
- **Version Conflicts**
    - Difficult to manage **conflicting library versions**
- **Scalability Issues**
    - Cannot scale individual components independently
- **Deployment Complexity**
    - Changes require deploying the entire application
- **Technology Lock-in**
    - **Hard to adopt new technologies** for specific components

## 💛 Microservices

`Microservices` architecture **breaks down a monolithic application into smaller**, independent services that:

- Can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
- Communicate through well-defined APIs
- Can use different technologies and frameworks
- Are organized around business capabilities

### 🤍 How to Run Microservices

1. **Single OS Deployment**
    - Simplest approach but limited isolation
    - Services share OS resources
    - **Potential for conflicts and resource contention**
2. **Virtual Machine Approach**
    - **Single VM**: All services in one VM
        - Better isolation than single OS
        - Still potential for conflicts
    - **Multiple VMs**: One VM per service
        - Complete isolation
        - Resource-intensive
        - **Higher operational overhead**
3. **Kubernetes Solution**
    - **`Containerization`**: Each service **runs in its own container**
    - **`Self-contained`**: **Libraries and dependencies are packaged with the service**
    - **Benefits**:
        - Lightweight compared to VMs
        - Consistent environment across development and production
        - Easy scaling and management
        - Built-in service discovery and load balancing
    - **Best Practice**: Each service should be:
        - Independently deployable
        - Loosely coupled
        - Focused on a single business capability

# 💚 Kubernetes

## :kubernetes: What is the Kubernetes?

- Kubernetes is for **containerized application**
- It keep **track of micro services automatically**

## 💛 Key Goals

### 🤍 Maximize Capacity

Distribute containers in a logical and efficient way

### 🤍 Adapt to Demand

Scale up/down fast with the ops we have already

### 🤍 Don’t Go Dark

Keep processes continuously running and healthy

### 🤍 Abstraction

- Give us power over **what gets down**
    - without micro-manage ‘how’

## 💛 Notations

### 🤍 Pod and Container

<aside>

**Pod sees container, Kubernetes sees Pods** 

</aside>

- `Pods` are **smallest building block** in Kubernetes
    - Contains one or more containers
        - **Typically one container**, but it can contain two or more containers when they are highly inter-connencted
    - **Containers in a pod share network and storage**
    - `Pod` sees the `container` as running applications inside it

### 🤍 Node and Cluster

- `Node` means a physical or **virtual machine**
    
    ![image.png](attachment:9754db89-a158-43ef-a55a-2da8456c043e:image.png)
    
    - Runs multiple pods
    - **Managed by Kubernetes control plane**
- `Cluster` means collection of nodes
    
    ![image.png](attachment:b1115985-00ac-4274-a1fa-01bfa50460a7:image.png)
    
    - **Has control plane (master) and worker nodes**
    - Control plane manages the entire cluster

## 💛 Abstracted Infrastructure of Kubernetes

### 🤍 Why Abstracted Infra is Needed?

- **You don't need to worry about which server your app runs on**
- Same app works on different platforms
    - which can be  AWS, Google Cloud, or your laptop
- No need to manually install stuff on each machine

### 🤍 Immutable Template

- Imagine a **recipe** that creates identical copies
- Write YAML file once, use it many times
- Never change running app directly - always use template

### 🤍 Benefits

- **No "it works on my machine" problems**
- Easy to fix - just redeploy from template
- All environments look exactly the same

## 💛 Self-Healing in Kubernetes

Kubernetes ensures that your applications remain available and resilient by **automatically detecting and correcting issues**. Let's explore how this works.

### 🤍 Ideal State vs Actual State

- **`Ideal State`**: The desired configuration we define in `yaml` file (e.g., 3 replicas of a pod).
- **`Actual State`**: The current state of the cluster.
- **Controller Loop**: **Kubernetes continuously compares the actual state to the ideal state** and makes adjustments to reconcile any differences.

### 🤍 Update Mechanisms

- **`Pod Restarts`**
    - If a container crashes, Kubernetes restarts it based on the defined `restartPolicy`.
- **`Replica Management`**
    - Controllers like Deployments ensure the **specified number of pod replicas** are running.
- **`Node Failures`**
    - If a node goes down, **pods are rescheduled on healthy nodes**.
- **`Health Checks`**
    - **Liveness Probes**: Determine if a container is running. If it fails, the container is restarted.
    - **Readiness Probes**: Check if a container is ready to serve traffic. If it fails, the pod is removed from service endpoints.
    - **Startup Probes**: Verify if an application has started. Useful for applications with long startup times.

### 🤍 Labels

Labels are **key-value pairs** attached to Kubernetes resources.

- ✅ They help categorize and organize resources.
- ✅ They're essential for selectors (e.g. Services, Deployments).

*Example:*

```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    app: my-app
    environment: production

```

This Pod is labeled with `app: my-app` and `environment: production`, making it easy to select and group for services or monitoring.

---

### 🤍 Services

A **Service** provides a stable IP and DNS name for accessing a group of Pods.

It uses **label selectors** to route traffic only to healthy Pods.

- Automatically load-balances traffic across matching Pods
- If a Pod fails, it is **automatically removed** from the service's endpoints

*Example:*

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376

```

This service routes traffic to any Pod with the label `app: my-app` on port 9376.

---

<aside>

With **Labels + Services**, Kubernetes can self-heal:

- It restarts failed Pods,
- Removes them from traffic routing,
- And reschedules them on healthy nodes — automatically!
